# Tkinter_Touchscreen_Application
This was part of my senior project at Loomis Chaffee. If run through a computer (Raspberry Pi) on a touchscreen display, users can interactively learn about the PHI at Loomis Chaffee.
Make sure these are downloaded on the device: Tkinter, PIL, tkhtmlview (you can all download them through pip)
